## Purpose
To provide structure to the government in the form of dedicated roles for both people and property.
## Article 1 - People
### Section 1
Positions in government are to be appointed by the upcoming president within one week of the election closing. The president has the ability to dismiss a position holder if they have not fulfilled their duties; however, they must seek majority approval in a public vote to appoint someone else to that role. If a president fires a member of government but cannot get the votes to replace that member, the president must carry out the duties of that member as well as the duties of the president for the rest of that term.

The office of the president is a term for all members of government, including the president. If a duty is required of a member of the office of the president and a member of government has explicit permission to perform that duty, then that member will be responsible for executing it. If no member exists with the permission to perform that duty, then "office of the president" refers to the current president.

A government worker is not appointed by the president, and is instead appointed by a government member to help achieve that member's duties. Government workers' wages are determined by the employer, and they can be both hired and fired at will by that employer. However, they must pay the worker using allocated funds from the Treasury.
### Section 2
A member of government has the following duties:
1. To fulfill their role in the government structure
2. To advise the president in their decision making
3. To propose laws to the president that fulfills their role
Failure to meet these duties leaves a member of government liable to be dismissed by the president.
### Section 3
The role of "Treasury Manager" is a government member that manages the assets of the government, such as the $Fi, as well as any item storage solutions owned by the government. The Treasury Manager is given explicit permission to move resources, allocate funds, pay members, and make decisions about the long term strategy of $Fi. If disputes are to arise regarding government assets, the Treasury Manager is to be the deciding factor.
### Section 4
The role of "Transportation and Communication Manager" is a government member that manages means of public transportation throughout Fuhai, as well as avenues for communication. It is the duty of the Transportation and Communication Manager to make sure that all registered plots of land are:
1. Accessible via chain drives and/or trains
2. Registered with a proper address beginning with "Fi:" and ending in ":Mail"; this address must be on the deed for the property before it can be signed by the office of the president
3. Connected to the mail system and available for receiving mail
Mail addresses must be clear and have some information about the location. If an acronym is needed to make the address fit in 16 characters, it will be permitted.
### Section 5
The role of "Technology and Infrastructure Manager" is a government member that manages and maintains public and government-owned infrastructure. It is the duty of the Technology and Infrastructure Manager to:
1. Keep a public workshop running with the basic necessities for using Create recipes
2. Provide the government with supplies needed to build infrastructure
3. Provide the government with infrastructure as seen in Article 2
4. Provide technological solutions to ongoing problems in Fuhai
5. Manage and regulate the use of potentially dangerous/exploitable technology among civilians
### Section 6
The role of "Justice Enforcer" is a government member that provides the means to enforce the laws of Fuhai on its civilians. It is the duty of the Justice Enforcer to:
1. Provide ample and available jail space for offending civilians
2. Carry out punishments
3. Uphold the rights of citizens
4. Provide a method of resolving civil conflicts
## Article 2 - Places
### Section 1
The Government Building must facilitate the following actions by the government:
1. Private meetings
2. Secure document storage
3. Secure asset storage
Only members of government are to be permitted entry into the building unless given express permission from a member of government.
### Section 2
The Post Office must be a hub for package-based communication, have direct access to the Fuhai chain drive/train network. It must be free for all civilians to send mail. The Post Office is to keep records of every address registered in Fuhai, along with the name of the property owner.
### Section 3
The Courthouse must be the location of all property, civil, and criminal disputes in Fuhai. In order to resolve a dispute, the Justice Enforcer must allow both sides of the dispute to be heard in front of a jury of 5 or more odd-numbered people and mediated by a judge who is a government worker. Civil and property disputes will be resolved with a majority vote by the jury. Criminal disputes must be resolved with an agreement of at least 80% by the jury. If the Justice Enforcer is personally involved in the dispute, then the office of the president must nominate an alternative to act as Justice Enforcer for that dispute.
### Section 4
New government construction projects can begin at the discretion of the Technology and Infrastructure Manager, who should continue to fund new projects as the needs of the country grows.
### Section 5
Citizens have the right to their own property, including to sell it. Upon the sale of land, a new deed needs to be signed by the president and the new owner must be added to the registry of addresses in the Post Office. Property holders have the right to use their property in any way that does not directly break a Fuhai law. They are free to sell goods and services on their property, as well as take residence there, as long as they are a citizen of Fuhai. Non-citizens can own property in Fuhai, but cannot reside there.
### Section 6
Property owned by a citizen is considered private property, meaning that all activity on that property by another citizen must be done with permission. If a citizen trespasses on another citizen's private property without permission, then that citizen is liable to be punished in civil court. Damaging another citizen's property is also punishable.
### Section 7
Deeds are the final say of property lines and ownership. If a citizen cannot produce a deed stating their ownership of land, then that citizen cannot be proven to own that land. If two or more deeds exist for that plot of land, then the newest registered deed determines property lines and ownership, as long as it was signed by the at-the-time current president.
