# Preface
The purpose of this act is to define activity considered criminally illegal in Fuhai, as well as reasonable punishments for said activity. The goal of defining legal activity is not to intrude on citizens' personal lives, which the government does not police. Instead, the goal is to discourage behavior that is harmful to fellow citizens and the government, as well as to prevent further harmful behavior from the guilty individual.
# Article 1
The purpose of this article is to define legal punishments. Punishments not explicitly allowed are not permitted to be issued under the authority of the Justice Enforcer.
## Section 1
Section 1 punishments are minor deterrents from light illegal behavior. Allowable punishments include:
### Subsection 1: Fines
A fine is a mandatory transfer of monetary value to the government of Fuhai. Fines must be paid in the national currency Fim. Fines cannot exceed the liquid and non-liquid value available to the guilty party.
### Subsection 2: Mandatory Volunteer Work
Mandatory volunteer work refers to a required amount of work to be done for the government by a guilty party. Volunteer time is to be given in increments of ten minutes, not exceeding 120 minutes of work. The guilty party is required to complete their volunteer work within a week of sentencing. Volunteer time must be approved by a government member or worker.
### Subsection 3: Mandatory Withdrawal
Mandatory withdrawal is the required transferring of an asset to the government. The asset can be an item, a piece of land, or a machine. The government cannot compel a guilty party to transfer their living space or other physical necessities. Withdrawal should be limited to cases where continual possession of an asset could lead to further illegal activity.
## Section 2
Section 2 punishments are serious deterrents from illegal behavior. Allowable punishments include:
### Subsection 1: Mandatory Confinement
Mandatory confinement is required time in a confinement center ran by the Fuhai government. Confined persons are not allowed the same freedoms as normal Fuhai citizens; their limitations are as follows:
1. They cannot freely travel without approval of the office of the Justice Enforcer
2. They cannot possess property in their confinement cell without permission
3. They cannot make financial transactions

Mandatory confinement time is to be given in increments of 24 hours, not exceeding 30 days. Confined persons are to be given meals, provided infrastructure, and otherwise taken care of physically. Confined persons cannot be dropped or killed unless a separate punishment explicitly allows it. Confined persons must keep a spawn point inside their assigned confinement center.
### Subsection 2: Drops
Drops are the destruction of a specific number of shells owned by the guilty party. Drops are to be carried out, if possible, by temporarily confining the guilty party for enough time to force them to set their spawn point and drop them as authorized by the punishment. Drops are not to exceed 50 shells destroyed, and no drops will be authorized while the guilty party has an unstable core, unless another punishment authorizes destruction of the guilty party's core.
## Section 3
Section 3 punishments are dire punishments exclusive to guilty parties who have illegally caused the destruction of another person's core, or who are likely to cause the destruction of a person's core in the future. Allowable punishments are as follows:
### Subsection 1: Core Destruction
Core destruction is the government mandated execution of a guilty party by continually dropping them until their core breaks. Core destruction is the most severe form of punishment available, and is only authorized in extreme cases where allowing the guilty party to continue existing is no longer a reasonable option. Core destruction must be signed off by the president, as well as verified by a majority public vote.
### Subsection 2: Permanent Confinement
Permanent confinement is the mandatory confinement of a guilty party for as long as their core exists. Permanent confinement is a very serious punishment designed to functionally remove a guilty party from society without destroying their core. Permanent confinement must be approved by the president at the time of sentencing. Permanent confinement does not require the confinement facility to provide the guilty party necessities like other confined persons.
## Section 4
Section 4 punishments are exclusive to members of government. If a member of government does not fulfill their obligations or uses their position of power for malicious and selfish purposes, they may be subject to a Section 4 punishment. Allowable punishments are as follows:
### Subsection 1: Impeachment
Impeachment is the process of removing a guilty party from eligibility to be in a position of power in the government. An impeached party cannot be elected for president or appointed as any kind of member of government. Impeachment requires approval by majority public vote.
### Subsection 2: Removal
Removal is the immediate termination of a guilty party's membership to the Fuhai government. Removed parties, if not impeached, can be re-appointed or run for president in the future, but are removed from office until that time. Removal does not require any kind of public vote.

### Subsection 3: The Prosecution
The prosecution is the person or group who wants to convince the jury that there has been a crime committed, and that they should agree to find the accused guilty. The prosecution is appointed by the Justice Enforcer. The Justice Enforcer cannot be on the prosecution team.

Section 2 describes the process through which the prosecution and the defense can make their case in front of a jury and have that case decided on.
### Subsection 1: Filing Charges
In order for a trial to begin, the prosecution must file charges against the accused party, and provide those charges to the judge. These charges must be comprehensive and include all crimes allegedly committed by the accused. After receiving the charges document, the judge must select a jury and set an initial date for trial.
### Subsection 2: Pre-Trial

A single juror disagreeing will lead to a not-guilty verdict.
### Subsection 5: Sentencing
